As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft Research provided Microsoft Biomedical Search, and AI-powered search tool to help researchers and scientists identify relevant publications available from PubMed and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). This tool was provided on a short-term basis for public benefit and was deprecated on September 1, 2023.

This repository serves as a resource for those looking to find the paper describing this system. For additional questions, please reach out to biomedsearchfeedback@microsoft.com.
